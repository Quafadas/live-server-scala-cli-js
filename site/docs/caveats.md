# Caveats

Much of the frontend world is setup assuming that you in fact, are using a bundler.

That means that not _all_ stuff on npm, can in fact be easily consumer through ESModules.

Examples;

It is usually possible to work around such limitations, but it is not pain free.

I strongly suspect though that as time marches formward ESModules will become the norm, and this limitation will become irrelevant.
